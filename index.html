  <p>* DMCA  <br>The Filmobleja site operates in accordance with Section 17 of the U.S.C 512 Law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). No files or data are on our servers and we are not responsible for the posts of our members.

Access to video content via embedded code does not constitute copyright infringement, as confirmed by the judgment of the Seventh Court of Appeal in the myVidster LINK case.

All movies and series embedded on the Filmobleja portal are stored on web site servers such as openload.com, youtube.com and the like.

"Filmobleja" saves episodes exclusively in the form of a text file which is then run in the video playback (embedding) application.
